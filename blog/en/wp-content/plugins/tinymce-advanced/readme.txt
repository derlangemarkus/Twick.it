== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= No styles are imported in the Styles drop-down menu. =

These styles (just the classes) are imported from your current theme style.css file. However some themes use @import to load the actual css file(s). Tiny does not follow these links. To make the classes appear, add their names to tadv-mce.css file located in "tinymce-advanced/css". You do not need to copy the whole classes if you do not want them to appear in the editor, just add the names, like that:

    .my-class{}
    .my-other-class{}

= I have just installed this plugin, but it does not do anything. =

Log out of WordPress, clear your browser cache, quit and restart the browser and try again. If that does not work, there may be a caching proxy or network cache somewhere between you and your host. You may need to wait for a few hours until this cache expires.

= When I add "Smilies", they do not show in the editor. =

The "Emotions" button in TinyMCE adds the codes for the smilies. The actual images are added by WordPress when viewing the Post/Page. Make sure the checkbox "Convert emoticons to graphics on display" in "Options - Writing" is checked.

= The plugin does not add any buttons. =

Make sure the "Disable the visual editor when writing" checkbox under "Users - Your Profile" is **not** checked.

= I still see the "old" buttons in the editor =

Click on "Remove options" on the plugin settings page and then on "reload this page" to reset all buttons.
