Add links to [Twick.it](http://twick.it) into posts and comments. Also shows popup with definition of the marked word.

== Description ==

This plugin adds some [Twick.it](http://twick.it) functions into your wordpress blog. 

First you can mark phrases with a `[twickit]` tag. The plugin looks up the phrase at Twick.it. If there
is a definition for the phrase it will be shown both as a tooltip and with a link to the adequate page 
at Twick.it.

If you want the plugin to find any word with a corresponding Twick.it-definition in a paragraph you can 
surround the textblock with `[twickitall]`. The plugin will look up any word in the marked block.

Last but not least you can enable the so called Marker-Popup-Feature. If enabled your readers can mark
any phrase in your blog to look it up at Twick.it. After marking a text with the cursor a small popup 
will show the available definitions at Twick.it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `twickit_links.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin at the config page
1. Mark text with `[twickit]foo bar[/twickit]` in posts or comments to add a link to Twick.it

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The phrase I like to link to differs from the marked words. How can I arrange that? =

Just specify the word you like to limk to in the `[twickit]`-Tag like this: 
"`I like [twickit word="cookie"]cookies[/twickit].`"
