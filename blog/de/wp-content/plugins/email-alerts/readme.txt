Allows users to configure whether they wish to be alerted when a comment is added, comment held, post posted.

== Description ==

This plugin adds three checkboxes to the WordPress profile page allowing you to setup notifications for these events: a comment is added, a comment is held pending approval, a post posted. If you have permission to edit other users, you can also setup notifications for them... so when you go on holiday, you can set a colleague to receive the comment notifications while you're away.

Users can only receive notifications for comments if they have the authority to moderate comments, and can only receive post publication notifications if they have the authority to publish posts.

Why do I need this?
-------------------

The current WordPress admin settings are confusing regarding notifications and break down with more than one administrator. Currently there's two settings in Settings > Discussion, which are titled

Email me whenever:

*  Anyone posts a comment
*  A comment is held for moderation 

This leads the user to believe that they are setting an option on their user account, when in fact they are setting a global option for the blog as a whole. Further, this option triggers notification of only one administrator (whichever is in the admin_email option, which I believe is set on installation). There's more detail in the [WordPress Trac bug ticket 7835](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7835).
