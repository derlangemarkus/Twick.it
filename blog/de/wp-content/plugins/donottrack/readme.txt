Small plugin to stop other WordPress plugins from including 3rd party tracking from e.g. media6degrees and quantcast.

== Description ==
Small plugin to stop other WordPress plugins from including 3rd party tracking from e.g. media6degrees and quantcast.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What works now? =
* Stop images or javascript being loaded form quantcast & media6degrees by adding them via document.write

= What does not work (yet)? =
* There's a lot other tracking services that are not disabled by this plugin yet, contact me if you know of a plugin that includes other services
* I'm working on a version that also stops tracking being injected with innerHTML or appendChild and insertBefore

= What else might be added? =
* a widget which explains tracking + link to a page where visitors can opt out of many tracking/ advertising services at once (based on http://www.privacychoice.org/)
* known opt-out code to disable tracking for all visitors of your blog (e.g. no_3p=true for add2any) -> any input is more then welcome

= How can I help? =
* Provide me with links to plugins that include browser-based tracking + domain where the tracking is done
* Provide me with known opt-out code (javascript) to disable tracking services on a site (instead of your visitors having to opt out)
* Tell plugin writers you're not happy with 3rd party tracking, tell your visitors about tracking & privacy, link to e.g. http://www.privacychoice.org/ (and the opt-out tools they provide)

== Changelog ==
